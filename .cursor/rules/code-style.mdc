# Code Style & Comments

- All comments must be written in English
- Use clear, descriptive comments that explain the "why" not just the "what"
- Prefer self-documenting code over excessive comments
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Follow React best practices (hooks, component composition, etc.)
- Ensure proper error handling
